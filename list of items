********************** to show the list of previous orders *******************
CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THE DATABASE

onChildAdded() // it has ChildEventListener

Retrieve lists of items or listen for additions to a list of items. 
This callback is triggered once for each existing child and then again every time a new child is added to the specified path. 
The DataSnapshot passed to the listener contains the the new child's data.

the list of orders of the shooper are added to the database by going to the firebase console -> realtime database add list there or in the main code add the child elements.

ChildEventListener childEventListener = new ChildEventListener() {
    @Override
    public void onChildAdded(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String previousChildName) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onChildAdded:" + dataSnapshot.getKey());

        // A new comment has been added, add it to the displayed list
        Comment comment = dataSnapshot.getValue(Comment.class);

        // ...
    }

// when a ValueEventListener is added the entire list is displayed as a single snapshot and it can looped next.

myTopPostsQuery.addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {
    @Override
    public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {
        for (DataSnapshot postSnapshot: dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {
            // TODO: handle the post
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {
        // Getting Post failed, log a message
        Log.w(TAG, "loadPost:onCancelled", databaseError.toException());
        // ...
    }
});

// when entire list is present we have to order the list by a key.
// orderByChild()	  Order results by the value of a specified child key.
// orderByKey()   	Order results by child keys.
// orderByValue()	  Order results by child values.

**********************************************************************************

JSON supports two widely used (amongst programming languages) data structures.

A collection of name/value pairs. Different programming languages support this data structure in different names. 

Like object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.

An ordered list of values. In various programming languages, it is called as array, vector, list, or sequence.

Since data structure supported by JSON is also supported by most of the modern programming languages, it makes JSON a very useful data-interchange format.

******************* one possible table structure in JSON *************************

"userid" : {      // Firebase realtime database is a schemaless database in which the data is stored in JSON format So when you plan your database, you need to prepare the json structure in way that the data is accessible in easier way by avoiding nesting of child nodes.
        "orders":{
        "orderid8346":11.99,  // in JSON An object starts and ends with '{' and '}'. Between them, a number of string value pairs can reside. String and value is separated by a ':' and if there are more than one string value pairs, they are separated by ','.
        }
        }
